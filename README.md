## Inspiration

**App Idea:**
I have been using the Monthly Budget template of Google Sheets for months and decided that I should do try do build something based on that template. So yes, The Money Buddy is basically a cloned version of that template. Check that template out, it works like a charm!

**Design:**
While I haven't found out what kind of design that I should go with, below is a list of some Figma free design that I might just make a clone out of it. Huge thanks to these wonderful designers!
